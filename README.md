# Full Cycle Code of the PT6A-114

This is a full cycle code for the PT6A-114 engine. The code was developed for AERO 417 Aerospace Propulsion. In this repository, you will find the code for the engine, as well as the basic engine specs and code results. 


### Task 1:
This folder contains the code for the engine, as well as the engine specs. The code is written in Python. This code performs a full cycle analysis of the PT6A-114 engine, given the specs the user specifies in the `BasicSpecs.csv` file. Readers can find codes relevant to the engine in the:

        RealEngineCycle_TurboProp/task1/

### Task 2:
This folder contains the code for designing the axial component of a mixed compressor. The code is written in Python. Readers can find codes relevant to the engine in the:

        RealEngineCycle_TurboProp/task2/

### Task 3:
This folder contains the code for designing the radial variation of a mixed compressor's velocity triangles and airfoil geometry. The code is written in Python. Readers can find codes relevant to the engine in the:

        RealEngineCycle_TurboProp/task3/

### Task 4:
This folder contains the code for drawing the Axial Compressor Map. The code is written in Python. Readers can find codes relevant to the engine in the:

        RealEngineCycle_TurboProp/task4/

### Task 5:

This folder contains the work for task 5, the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis of the engine. Readers can find codes relevant to the engine in the:

        RealEngineCycle_TurboProp/task5/
