## __Task 3__

This folder contains the code for designing a row of an Axial Compressor. In this program we account for the Radial variation of the flow and airfoil geometry. 

* `task3_main.py` is the main file which calls the other files and runs the code. Readers are to run this code to perfom the analysis.
* `Steps.py` contains the functions for the steps of the analysis. These are the steps 1-22 listed in Dr. Cizmas' notes.
* `Station1Task3.csv` contains the data for the first station of the compressor. This data is the result of the analysis.
* `Station2Task3.csv` contains the data for the second station of the compressor. This data is the result of the analysis.
* `Station3Task3.csv` contains the data for calculating angles of the blade and stator. This data is the result of the analysis.
* `Station4Task3.csv` contains the data for the third station of the compressor. This data is the result of the analysis.
